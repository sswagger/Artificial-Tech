			<p>
				We started out as a small company that no one knew about, but we thought we had a product that every company that ever used cloud based software could use.
				So, we hung in there, and proved to many that <a href="products.html" class="alone-link white-link" id="open-circuits">Open Circuits</a> was something that they needed.
				Now, it is used by thousands around the world; and, some of our major customers impact tens of millions of people every year.
				AND... We even extended Open Circuits to be available to hobbyists and small scale companies.

			<h3>Goals</h3>
			<p>
				We are dedicated to helping our customers, in fact we even have a customer counter.
				This adjusts based on the number of accounts created or deleted. That's only accounts, not people!
			</p>
			<p>We are aiming to hit 6,000 accounts by the end of the year. That's approximately 8,000 users!</p>
