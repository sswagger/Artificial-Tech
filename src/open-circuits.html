			<h2>Open Circuits</h2>
			<h3>Summary</h3>
			<p>
				Open Circuits is a service that allow users to utilize and configure servers to do what ever they want.
				This is great for hobbyist who just want a blog website, or professionals who want an about-me website.
				All that can be implemented using Open Circuits.
			</p>
			<h3>History</h3>
			<p>
				Open Circuits started out as an open sourced User Interface (UI) for Imaginary Ideas' extension, Speedy Servers.
				When Speedy Servers was deprecated, Open Circuits had nowhere to go.
				So, we built a company out of it; offering freemium servers to whoever wanted one.
				We re-purposed the "Open" to refer to the freemium service and openness to all customers, instead of being open sourced.
			</p>
			<h3>Freemium</h3>
			<p>
				As stated above, Open Circuits is a freemium based service: depending on your subscription, you can have it for free until you reach a certain point.
				There are three freemium subscriptions: Blog, Hobby, and Pro.
				Blog is for the people who know nothing about setting up a server; they just want a website that works.
				This allows those people to use it for free until there are a certain amount of resources used per one hour.
				Hobby is for those people who know what they're doing, no hesitation.
				These servers aren't pre-configured to do anything, just what ever the user wants.
				Hobby servers max out when there is a curtain amount of data access and memory that is used within a week.
				Pro is for the small businesses; same setup as a hobby subscription, but this allows the users more memory.
				The freemium Pro subscription maxes out when a curtain number of requests hit the server within a day.
			</p>
			<h3>Bigger than Free</h3>
			<p>
				We also offer a "Bigger than Free" service.
				The cost for this is agreed upon when another company contacts us.
				We have a formula that we use to calculate price.
				It will take into account the resources used, memory needed, and the number of requests handled.
